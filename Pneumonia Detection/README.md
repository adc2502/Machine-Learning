# Pneumonia Detection Using X-Ray

Objective:

The objective is to be able to detect pneumonia with over 70% accuracy.

Method/Outcome:

I have not spent much time on this project as I have been busy with work and
trying to get back into shape. The dataset is pre prepared so I don't believe
any cleaning is required. I have setup a basic model which is 50% accurate. In
other words this model is currently just as bad as me at guessing. I hope to be
able to dedicate more time to this in the coming weeks.
