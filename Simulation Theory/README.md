# Simulation Theory

Objective:

The objective was the produce multiple paragraphs of text with enough complexity
that they would appear to come from different human beings. The next step was
to generate a new piece of text for each person at multiple stages of the
simulated humans life and watch it progress through life.

Method/Outcome:

The life of the
simulated human would be impacted by three factors.

Genetics which I programmed as emotions e.g. compassion, anxiety and greed.
(For these emotions and their weights I consulted a friend who studies
psychology at Edinburgh University).

Probability in the form of a Normal distribution which was used to pick values
such as height and weight.

Luck which was implemented as a random generator for values such as name,
school topics and favourite sports.

I quickly realised that the complexity was becoming too much for me to program
and I had the shelf the emotions for the time being.

At the moment I have completed 10-14 year olds which have a complexity I am
happy with. I have added varieties of word choice as well to help distinguish
the simulations. If you have a look at Humans.java and EarlyTeen.java you will
be able to see how I have used weights and distributions along with many other
methods to generate chaotic humans.

I have also used accurate data when it comes to weight, based on height, age
and the percentage chance of gender and sexual orientation is also based on UK
estimated (online sourced) data.

Here is an example output:

"Hello, I'm Alyssa.
I am 14. At school we are learning all about jungle animals, which is super
interesting. I like my teacher Mrs Stevens, because she lets me play on the
computers when I finish my work early. At school, my best friend is probably
Annabel, and we sit across from each other in class."

Although a lot of the data is not being used for this age group, it would be
important in calculating their emotions and also likely-hood of being good at
sports or interest in specific subjects (which is currently random) etc.
