I don't like my teacher Mrs Henry because she {never lets us play outside}.
never picks me for anything and always tells me off for nothing.
doesn't let us use the computers on friday like the other teachers.
is nice but sometimes a bit strict.
lets me play on the computers when I finish my work early.
tells us loads of cool storys and teaches us new games.
takes us on lots of trips and is always nice to me.
